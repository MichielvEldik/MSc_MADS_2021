        <h1>Left on the Sideline: A Spatial Explanation of why Some Consumers Write Online Reviews and Others Don't.</h1>
        <p>
          <b>Abstract:</b> There may be several potential reasons for consumers to provide not only a quantitative star rating review, but written feedback as well. This project seeks to explain how geospatial differences between consumers in Brazil can affect the rate of written review creation. The focus lies mainly on:

          		<ul>
			          <li>Culture;</li> 
		          	<li>Urbanicity;</li> 
        	      <li>Education, Health, & Per Capita Gross Income (Human Development Composite Index);</li> 
		          </ul>
		    <p>
		    The research is done using publicly available data on customer reviews from Brazil's e-commerce marketplace platform provider Olist. I've provided a seperate Rmarkdown page for each distinct step in the project. It only includes the state of Sao Paulo and hence serves as a small-scale demonstration of what I plan on doing for all - or most - of Brazil. Furthermore, it includes only simple analysis techniques for now,  I plan on moving to Bayesian Networks at some later point. <a href="to_do_list.html">To-do list</a>
